    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Okonomiyaki is a Japanese savory pancake that blends a flavorful batter of flour, dashi, and eggs with shredded cabbage, 
            green onions, and a choice of protein like pork or shrimp. Cooked on a griddle until golden and crispy, the pancake is 
            then brushed with a savory-sweet okonomiyaki sauce, topped with mayonnaise, and garnished with aonori and katsuobushi. 
            The result is a delicious and customizable dish that effortlessly combines textures and tastes, offering a delightful 
            culinary experience.
