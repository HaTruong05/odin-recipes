    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian baked pasta dish that layers wide sheets of flat pasta with rich, 
            flavorful ingredients. The layers typically consist of sheets of lasagna noodles, ricotta or 
            cottage cheese, a savory tomato-based meat sauce often including ground beef or sausage, and 
            generous amounts of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. The dish is then baked until the pasta is 
            tender and the cheeses on top turn golden brown, resulting in a hearty and comforting casserole 
            that embodies the perfect marriage of pasta, cheese, and a robust tomato sauce.

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions, or use oven-ready noodles</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium heat. Add chopped onions and minced garlic, cooking until softened</li>
            <li>Add ground beef or Italian sausage, breaking it up with a spoon, and cook until browned</li>
            <li>Stir in tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese with an egg, mixing well</li>
            <li>In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce</li>
            <li>Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce</li>
            <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a portion of the meat sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers, finishing with a final layer of noodles topped with sauce and a generous amount of shredded mozzarella and grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the top is golden brown</li>
            <li>Allow the lasagna to rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing. This helps the layers set</li>
            <li>Garnish with fresh chopped parsley before serving</li>
        </ol>
